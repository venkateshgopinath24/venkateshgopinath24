<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 About Me </h3>

An aspiring Data Analyst who enjoys solving tough problems. I love to work without boundaries, be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have good technical skills and a sound academic background in engineering and statistics.

During my work as a Business Analyst for about 2 years, I have developed a hard attitude on not giving up on my tasks. I was responsible for analyzing the needs of the various functional business areas within the organization and recommending system solutions or procedures. As a liaison between the business and IT departments, I needed to ensure that I modify or enhance existing application processes. Hence I am able to jump across verticals to deliver high-performing solutions.

I'm graduating in Dec 2023 and I'm interested in full-time Data Analyst / related roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at bogem.v@northeastern.edu
